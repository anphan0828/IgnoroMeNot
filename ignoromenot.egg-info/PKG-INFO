# IgnoroMeNot
IgnoroMeNot outputs a list of ignorome genes highly associated with other well-annotated genes. Ignorome genes are genes that have little to no validated experimental Gene Ontology annotations (see this [publication](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.2006643) or [this](doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0088889)). Strong associations between ignorome genes and well-annotated genes can help fill the gaps in the protein function space and improve the balance in knowledge between "annotation-rich" and "annotation-poor" genes.

## Installation
IgnoreMeNot is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/ignoromenot/). To install, enter this command in Terminal:

``pip install ignoromenot``

IgnoroMeNot can be installed with [conda](https://anaconda.org/anphan0828/ignoromenot). To install, use this command: 

``conda install -c anphan0828 ignoromenot``

### Required files:
#### Approach 1: provide pre-defined metric
IgnoroMeNot requires a tab-separated file of a list of genes/gene products with any single annotation metric (e.g. GO annotation count, information content, article count). Highest and lowest annotated genes are defined based on this metric. Below is an example of how the rank table should look like:

| Genes  | Metric            |
|--------|-------------------|
| NUDT4B | 55.34890734396416 |
|  HTT   | 99.78875455312165 |

#### Approach 2: provide Gene Ontology Annotation File (GAF)
Ignoromenot also supports the calculation of three per-protein metrics: GO annotation count ('ct'), Wyatt Clark information content ('ia'), article count ('pmid'), fractional count ('fc'), if provided a Gene Ontology Annotation File (GAF). If a GAF is provided, users need to specify which metric should be used for ranking (refer to usage).

#### For both approaches: 
Additionally, a STRING interaction network file of the organism to be examined is required and can be downloaded from [STRING](string-db.org/cgi/download). Example: E. coli [interaction network](https://stringdb-static.org/download/protein.links.full.v11.5/511145.protein.links.full.v11.5.txt.gz). Note: large STRING files (e.g., human-id:9606) may cause IDE to crash.

  --percentile_ppi PERCENTILE_PPI, -pppi PERCENTILE_PPI
                        Set a relative upper threshold for STRING protein-protein interaction score.
                        Cannot be provided simultaneously with --threshold_ppi.Example: -pppi 95
                        selects top 5% of associated pairs with highest score

Specifiers:
  --metric METRIC, -m METRIC
                        A single annotation metric obtained from GAF based on which the proteins will
                        be ranked. If not specified,proteins will be ranked based on annotation count.
                        Accepted metrics: ct, ic, ia. Default to 'ct'
  --aspect ASPECT, -a ASPECT
                        If GAF file is provided as input, specify which aspect of GO to rank the
                        proteins. If not specified, proteins will be ranked based on the total value
                        across 3 aspects. Accepted aspects: All, MFO, BPO, CCO. Default to 'All' (sum
                        accross 3 aspects).
  --recal RECAL, -r RECAL
                        Set recal to 1 if you are running on a new GAF, the program reconstructs the
                        ancestors and recalculates all metrics.Set recal to 0 if you only change the
                        threshold values but run on the same GAF, the program uses old files to save
                        time.Default to 1.

Required arguments:
  --input INPUT, -i INPUT
                        Input could be a path to a tab-separated file of a list of genes with any
                        single annotation metric (see above sample rank table) or Input could be a GO
                        Annotation File (GAF). In this case, filename must end with .gaf
  --stringppi STRINGPPI, -ppi STRINGPPI
                        The path to a STRING interaction network of the organism being examined. The
                        filename must start with the organism ID (e.g., 9606 for human, 511145 for
                        E.coli)
```
### Example usage:
Demo data of E.coli are included in the GitHub repository.
#### Input: tab-separated file containing a list of genes and values belonging to one metric:
```$ ignoromenot --input demodata/WyattClarkIC-perprotein.tsv --idtable demodata/511145.protein.aliases.v11.5.txt --stringppi demodata/511145.protein.links.full.v11.5.txt --percentile_top 90 --percentile_bot 1 --threshold_ppi 850```

This command reads 3 input files, where the genes coming from E.coli (511145) are ranked based on their Wyatt Clark information content (```WyattClarkIC-perprotein.tsv```). ```--percentile_top 90``` indicates that the genes at the top 10% with respect to Wyatt Clark infromation content are taken,
```--percentile_bot 1``` takes the bottom 1% annotated genes based on Wyatt Clark information content (those are the ignorome genes), and ```--threshold_ppi 850``` chooses STRING coexpression score (```511145.protein.links.full.v11.5.txt```) of 850 and above. The protein alias file (```511145.protein.aliases.v11.5.txt```) makes sure that protein names from different databases have their IDs mapped properly to STRING interaction network.

#### Input: GO annotation file of E.coli, from [GO Consortium](http://release.geneontology.org/):
```$ ignoromenot -i demodata/goa_eco27Jul22Filtered.gaf -id demodata/511145.protein.aliases.v11.5.txt -ppi demodata/511145.protein.links.full.v11.5.txt -m ct -a MFO -ptop 90 -pbot 1 -pppi 98```


### Output
IgnoroMeNot outputs a list of ignorome genes based on these parameters. If IgnoroMeNot is run with internet connection, it also provides users with all STRING interaction partners of these ignorome genes above ``--threshold_ppi`` via STRING API.
